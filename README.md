# 2022_IBM_Code_Challenge_Digicare

This project is made as part of IBM ISL Good Tech Scholar program2022. This Application allows the users and hospitals, clinics to view medical details and update them.




## Problem statement
The idea for this project was born from a grave realization – A large number of people die due to medical errors all around the world every year, and inadequate information flow is one of the root causes of such medical errors. Many accident victims are unconscious or unable to speak for themselves. Also, when a person is discharged from a facility, or transferred to another facility, some important data could get lost in the communication. These situations could lead to insufficient flow of information. 

In many a situation, medical treatments in the time of emergencies have been delayed as well as caused drastic side effects due to lack of information on the patient’s medical history. In normal scenario too forgetting medications that were once taken and prescriptions getting lost can cause drastic side effects. Also carrying a bunch of papers and filling forms during every hospital visit is tiresome and time consuming.

DigiCare is a web application that stores a person’s complete medical history. It keeps track of all visits to hospitals, clinics or doctors, medications taken and test reports. It stores a users complete medical history.
